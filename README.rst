JWST/MIRI Imaging/Coronagraphy Flux Calibration
===============================================

Code to measure flux calibration stars and compute the
flux calibration for JWST/MIRI Imaging and Coronagraphic filters.

Main goal is to fully automate this work to allow for straightforward
recalculations from the raw data to the final calibration factors for each
filter.  This enables tests of the sensitivity of the flux calibration
to changes in the jwst pipeline or any of the steps in the flux calibration
factor calculation.
