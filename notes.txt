Included PID 1027 and 1028 from commissioning
  F560W data for 1028 not included at the advice of Maca

F1800W, F2100W, F2550W
  source not present for HD180609 obs

Tested if large apertures provided more linear results
  idea to see if some kind of blurring of the PSF is an issue
    (e.g., charge spilling)
  maybe a bit more linear, but still strong non-linearity for some high flux stars
